# 📊 UPI Transactions Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Power BI interactive dashboard** built using a dataset in **Excel (xlsx)** format.  
The dataset was first cleaned and transformed using the **Power BI Query Editor**, after which multiple visualizations and slicers were developed to create a dynamic and easy-to-understand dashboard.

The main objective of this dashboard is to:
- Simplify **UPI transaction data** into an intuitive visual format.  
- Allow users to filter and analyze transactions across multiple dimensions.  
- Provide better insights into **how, when, and where** UPI is used for different purposes.
